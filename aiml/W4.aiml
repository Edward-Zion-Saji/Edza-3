Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said ``Chess is the
Drosophila of AI.'' He was making an analogy with geneticists' use of that
fruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectual
mechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, but
they do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by a
human chess player, substituting large amounts of computation for
understanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can build
human-level chess programs that do far less computation than do present
programs.

Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computers
play chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. It
is as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races and
concentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win these
races.

			</think>
The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which the
players take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our present
understanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing.
Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not as
much as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to be
divided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzed
separately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this in
chess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chess
programs compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doing
thousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as much
computation.

Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness.

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT IQ</pattern>
		<template>No. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children.
It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain score
to the child's age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQ
correlates well with various measures of success or failure in life, but
making computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlated
with their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back a
long sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities,
perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute with
at once. However, ``digit span'' is trivial for even extremely limited
computers.

However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI.

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL *</pattern>
		<template>Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can

somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary
to face this awkwardness.

		<template>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.
Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet
reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from
physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough
to learn much by reading.

		<template>
			<br/>
One of the biggest challenges facing a Java application<br/>
developer is finding a "lowest common denominator" subset of the<br/>
Java language that works on all the platforms and versions<br/>
out there.  The Java language itself is a moving target.<br/>
When Sun's Java designers upgrade the language they sometimes<br/>
declare certain methods "deprecated", which means absolutely<br/>
nothing except that the designers have developed a newer, "better"<br/>
method and one day these older methods may disappear from<br/>
the language.  Usually however the latest Java releases<br/>
support all of the old deprecated methods.<br/>
